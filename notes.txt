Code initialization
--------------------
--> I didn't got ay boiler plate for this one.. First I created a server.js file.. then installed express
"npm install express"

--> It installed node_modules..

--> Then created package.json file and adede express in dependencies..
then created all folders manually

--> to install any module " npm i <modulename> " (eg: npm i mongoose)
